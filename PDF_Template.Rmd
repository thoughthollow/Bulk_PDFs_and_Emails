Dear `r params$forenames` `r toupper(params$surname)`,
\newline
\newline
\newline
As you may be aware, THE ORGANISATION has been experiencing an access issue with RESOURCE. The issue is on the vendor side and as of the current moment, THE VENDOR has still not resolved the issue. We sincerely apologise for the inconvenience.

However, we are pleased to announce that we have arranged a **temporary workaround solution**, and this we will leave in place until the issue is resolved.

THE ORGANISATION has created a temporary account for you in cooperation with OTHER ENTITY. This measure will ensure your continued access.  Please note that this temporary account can only be used for THE VENDOR content, and you still need to use your normal access for other resources.


* **Your Temp. Username is:** \fontencoding{T1}\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont `r params$username`
\normalfont
* **Your Password is:** \fontencoding{T1}\fontfamily{pcr}\selectfont `r params$password`

\normalfont
Using THE SYSTEM with the above new credentials is slightly different than normal. \newline
See the following page for instructions.
